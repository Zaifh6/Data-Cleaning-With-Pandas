# Data Cleaning with Pandas

Welcome to the Data Cleaning with Pandas project! This project involves cleaning and preparing a movies dataset for analysis using the Pandas library in Python.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform a raw movies dataset into a clean, structured format that is ready for analysis.
